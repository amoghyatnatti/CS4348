# CS 4348 Project 1

This project was implemented in C++ and uses a fork to distinguish the CPU and memory processes. 

## Files
`sample5.txt` - This custom testcase that I created is supposed to print out CS with ASCII characters.
`sample5_output.txt` - Shows the desired output for `sample5.txt`
`Project1Summary.docx` - Contains the required project 1 summary
`project1.cpp` - Contains the entirety of the project code

## How to Compile and Execute the Project

1. G++ needs to be installed onto the OS
2. Run `sudo g++ project1.cpp` to compile the file
3. Then we can run `./a.out <filename> <timer value>`
4. Example: `./a.out sample5.txt 30`

# CS 4348 Project 3

## Overview
This project was implemented in Java and uses the `jobs.txt` file for its input. The `jobs.txt` file has jobs ordered sequentially by arrival time with a corresponding letter. Each job also has a given service time. The program mimics and displays the results of 3 scheduling algorithms: First-Come-First-Served (FCFS), Shortest Process Next (SPN), and Highest Response Ratio Next (HRRN) in that order respectively.
